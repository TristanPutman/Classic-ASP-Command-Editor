Classic-ASP-Command-Editor
==========================

The Classic ASP Command Editor was written as a web-based replacement for the Java-based IBM Command Editor utility used to interface with an IBM DB2 database.

Initially built to allow you to easily execute and debug your SQL, it has since been expanded to allow you to export SQL results, perform simple DB2 Explains, format your SQL, and much more.

This tool utilizes Classic ASP/VBScript + jQuery.
